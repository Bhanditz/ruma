# Contributing to Ruma

Your participation and contributions to Ruma are greatly appreciated!

If you're interested in contributing code to help accelerate the development of Ruma, take a look at the [STATUS](STATUS.md) document to find unimplemented API endpoints and their tracking issues on GitHub. Any unimplemented API is up for grabs, though many may require subsystems that don't exist yet, which will require extra work.

Other types of contributions that are also welcome:

* Bug fixes
* Performance improvements
* Refactoring for clarity or reduced duplication
* Improved code organization
* Consistency fixes for API documentation phrasing and formatting

When in doubt, come chat in our Matrix room (see the [README](README.md)) to get help with anything you need.
